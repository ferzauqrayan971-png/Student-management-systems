# Student-management-systems
My name is Ferzauq Rayan, and this project is developed as a learning-based web assignment.
The Student Management System is a simple web-based application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The main purpose of this project is to understand the basic concepts of frontend web development and client-side interaction.
